All DONE.

Note:
1. Please follow this order to add documents(I dont do too much robust design):
  clear -> add noise -> add docs -> can test

2. Do not add the same docs from same file directly.
   the better way is clear first, then add docs again.

3. Can add docs from different files directly. no need to clear firstly.
  Just like the test case.

4. When add REAL docs set, please wait 12 seconds.
  Because I want to get the shorter preprocess time, 
  I just create the main index table in close function, before close database.
  So the time counter in this part is not accurate.
  I count it by myself, less than 12 seconds, 
  much faster than the guideline log's(26 seconds).
